Map:

**1. First Checkpoint** (at the beginning)

  Large Jump, hard corner to turn and some stairs to climb.

**2. Second Checkpoint** (after the stairs)

  Big ramp with a boost in the middle to help you reach the top, and in the peack a force that slows the car to make the more easy to do the edge.

**3. Third Checkpoint** (after the edge)
![Captura de pantalla 2024-01-14 212853](https://github.com/pcelaya/RacingCar/assets/125651873/cdd26938-a687-4efc-b392-3be5e230cfdc)
 Another hard corner to turn, next some walls to make a zig-zag and in the end some enemies (the orange sticks) that you have to avoid because it kills you.
